Overall IT information
================================
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP /ˈɛldæp/) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining 
distributed directory information services over an !Internet Protocol (IP)! network.[1] Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and 
Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network.
As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory. 
Similarly, a telephone directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number.
