Cluster & High availability terms
==================================
Mean Time Before Failure(MTBF)    -- the average operational only time between system failures

Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)      -- the average amount of time needed to troubleshoot and repair a failed system and bring it back to oprational state

Service Level Agreement (SLA)   -- contract btw a provider and consumer that sets the service reliability expectations

Disaster Recovery (DR)        -- set of measures that are used in case of a resource or service becomes unavailable

Cluster Types
----------------------------------
High Performance 		-- clusters that are a set of different machines working together hosting one or more tasks that require lots of computing resources

Load Balancing 			-- clusters serves as frond-end and receive client requests which then get distributed to different number servers

High Availability(Failover)		-- clusters that aim on reducing the downtime of critical resources to a minimum

Cluster Architectures
----------------------------------
Active/Passive			-- usually consist of one active node that serves client requests and one or more backup nodes. Usually implemented as a failover cluster

Active/Active/Ac		-- clusters typically consist of two identical nodes both servicing client requests. Usually achieved via a load balancing
